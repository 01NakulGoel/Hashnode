# || Introduction to WEBDEV Course by Nakul Goel || Beginner Friendly Advance Course || Entirely FREE ||

**A lot of students are facing many difficulties while studying for full stack development, there are three major problems:-**


1) **College**- they don't teach you what's required by the industry.

2) **Youtube**- The courses on youtube are good but there is no proper roadmap to study (students end up studying which is not required) and their doubts are never solved.

3) Good courses take a lot of money which many of us can't afford.


Considering this in mind me and my small team is developing a `FULL STACK DEVELOPER COURSE` that will be free of cost.
