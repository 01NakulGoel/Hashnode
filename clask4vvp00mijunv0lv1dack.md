# Lets Start

Actually, this is very basic to understand, like in maths we have addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. we also have the same thing in the programming languages but there are some important things to keep in mind while using this so let's start by understanding what are operators, operands, and results.

## Operands:-
The quantity on which an operation is to be done.

## Operators:-
Any symbol that indicates an operation to be performed such as (+,-,/,* etc.)

Types of Operators in JavaScript

1) Addition(+)

2) Subtraction (-)

3) Division (/)

4) Multiplication (*)

5) **% (Modulo) output is remainder**

This operator in a programming language is known as the modulo operator which provides a remainder when two operands are divided.
let's understand it:-

when you do operation 5%2 then this operator will provide the `remainder` part as the value.

**Use cases:-**
1) it helps us to identify whether a number is odd or even. for ex: for an odd number, number%2 will always be 1 and for an even number, it will always be 0.



6)  `**`(exponentiation operator) 2**4=2 , it basically give us the power. 

we can re-write to understand 2**4 as 2*2*2*2 which is 2 multiplied by itself for four times.

now let's understand some important things:-

yesterday we learned about strings i.e. what are strings and how they are used. 

# **string addition - concatenation**

when we combine strings together using the + operator it is known as concatenation as a string.

```
console.log('Rosy'+'Sharma')=RosySharma
console.log(   'Rosy' + '  ' + 'Sharma'   )=Rosy Sharma
```

# \n 

to print something in multiple lines we can use \n

```
1) console.log('Rahul, '\n' ,'Sharma)
```

concatenation can remove unwanted spaces due to ',' 

```
1) console.log('rahul' + '\n' + 'sharma')

2) console.log('rahul','\nsharma')

3) console.log('rahul\nsharma')
```

Assignment:

Q1 declare a variable called `myNumber1` and assign it to value 10 and then console 10%2, declare another variable `myNumber2` and assign it to value 5 and console myNumber2%2. then add both numbers and console its modulo by 2?

Q2 declare a variable `myName` and assign your name to it. declare another variable `webdev` and assign a value `I will be a full stack developer.` print both variables in different lines using \n?

Q3 declare a new variable named name1 and assign your name to it. in the console print `My name is name1`.
it should display your name, use concatenation.
