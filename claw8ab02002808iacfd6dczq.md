## I use this four-step approach to solve the problems:- 

- **Define the problem**

  First of all, read the problem carefully, and see what this problem wants.

- **Analyse the problem**

  Analyze the problem and see what is the solution that this problem wants and try to write a solution for that.

- **Implement a solution from the analysis**

  Try to read your solution and implement it.

- **Evaluate your implementation**

  Evaluate your solution and see if your solution can pass all the test cases and if not then again define your problem, analyze it then implement and then evaluate the solution.
