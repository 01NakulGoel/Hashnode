# Today's topic is Objects in JS.

Before understanding the objects let's deep dive into the limitation of the array:-

let's understand it by an example:

Rahul, Suraj, Ashutosh, and John are the employees of meta. the salary each one draws are `1,00,000`, `4,00,000` ,`5,00,000` and `1,00,000` resp.

we can add this data to the array as follows

```javascript
let employess= ['Rahul', 'Suraj', 'Ashutosh', 'John']
let salary = ['1,00,000','4,00,000','5,00,000','1,00,000']

```

Suppose now I need to find the salary of Ashutosh, for that first we need to find an index of Ashutosh in the employees' array, and then from that index, we can find the salary of Ashutosh.

### But is it a good approach?

Suppose a company has 5000 employees and we store their data in such a way meanwhile an employee had left the company then we had to change all the arrays associated with it because an employee can also have multiple details as well.

To address such situations objects were introduced.

# What is an Object?

The object is basically a data structure in which data is stored in key-value pairs.

## How to declare an Object?

```javascript
var details={}
```

in object the data are stored in key-value pairs

```javascript
var employees = {
Rahul:'1,00,000',
Suraj:'4,00,000',
Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
John:'1,00,000'
}
```

# Properties of object

1.  **<mark>Accessing the value</mark>**
    
    ## Dot Notation
    
    **Syntax**
    
    ```javascript
     object.key
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    var employees = {
    Rahul:'1,00,000',
    Suraj:'4,00,000',
    Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
    John:'1,00,000'
    }
    
    console.log(employees.Rahul) //it will give value of rahul
    console.log(employees.Suraj) //it will give value of suraj
    console.log(employees.Ashutosh) //it will give value of ashutosh
    console.log(employees.John) //it will give value of John
    ```
    
    # Bracket Notation
    
    **Syntax**
    
    ```javascript
     object["key"]
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    var employees = {
    Rahul:'1,00,000',
    Suraj:'4,00,000',
    Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
    John:'1,00,000'
    }
    
    console.log(employees['Rahul']) //it will give value of rahul
    console.log(employees['Suraj']) //it will give value of suraj
    console.log(employees['Ashutosh']) //it will give value of ashutosh
    console.log(employees['John']) //it will give value of John
    ```
    
2.  **<mark>Adding new key</mark>**
    
    1.  Dot Notation
        
        ```javascript
        object.key=value
        
        var employees = {
        Rahul:'1,00,000',
        Suraj:'4,00,000',
        Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
        John:'1,00,000'
        }
        
        //To add new employee we can do 
        employees.Nishant='2,00,000'
        
        console.log(employees) 
         /*{Ashutosh: "5,00,000".
        John: "1,00,000",
        Nishant: "2,00,000",
        Rahul: "1,00,000",
        Suraj: "4,00,000"}*/
        ```
        
    2.  Bracket Notation
        
        ```javascript
        object['key']=value
        
        var employees = {
        Rahul:'1,00,000',
        Suraj:'4,00,000',
        Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
        John:'1,00,000'
        }
        
        //To add new employee we can do 
        employees['Nishant']='2,00,000'
        
        console.log(employees) 
         /*{Ashutosh: "5,00,000".
        John: "1,00,000",
        Nishant: "2,00,000",
        Rahul: "1,00,000",
        Suraj: "4,00,000"}*/
        ```
        
3.  **<mark>Deleting a key</mark>**
    
    ```javascript
    var employees = {
    Rahul:'1,00,000',
    Suraj:'4,00,000',
    Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
    John:'1,00,000'
    }
    delete employees.Rahul   // it will delete rahul key
    delete employees['Suraj']  // it will delete rahul key
    ```
    

# loops in object

The object cannot be iterated with a normal for loop as an object doesn't have an index as numbers. so to iterate objects we have a special loop that is <mark>for in</mark> loop.

```javascript
var employees = {
Rahul:'1,00,000',
Suraj:'4,00,000',
Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
John:'1,00,000'
}

for(let key in employees){
// Keep in mind here you need to use box notation.
// also do console.log(key)

console.log(employees[key])

}
```

# Arrays Inside Object

we can store an array inside objects as well.

```javascript
let detail = {
      title: "FB 3-Day: 3 Workouts Per Week for 2 Weeks",
      price: "7.99",
      difficultyLevel: [ 3,4],
      bodyFocus: "Total Body",
      equipmentData: ["Dumbbell", "Mat" ],
      trainingTypeData: ["Strength Training"]}
```

as in the above example, we have stored an array in an object.

we can store any data structure and data type as a value in an object such as a number, boolean, string, bigInt, array, and object as well.

Even we can store functions as well in the value part which we will learn about in the next session.

## The object inside the object (Nested Object)

```javascript

let school = {
  class11: {
      rahulMarks:  { english: 99, hindi: 100, maths: 70 },
   
  },
};
// to access the marks of english
school['class11']['rahulMarks']['english']
```

# Assignment

1.  create an object with five names as keys and give them a value.
    
    print all the keys using for in loop.
    
2.  You are given a variable
    
    ```javascript
    let str='asdnbknsadknsadnjk'
    ```
    
    To make an object using a loop that will give the key as the character and the value as number of characters.
    
    **<mark>Sample Input</mark>**
    
    let str='saaslaa'
    
    **<mark>Sample output</mark>**
    
    {a:4,s:2,l:1}
