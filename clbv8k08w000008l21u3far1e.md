# Today's topic is Objects in JS.

Before understanding the objects let's deep dive into the limitation of the array:-

let's understand it by an example:

Rahul is a user of your website and you need to store his data such as name, email, password, and mobile.

we can add this data to the array as follows

```javascript
let users= ['name','email','password','mobile']
let data = ['Rahul','rahul@gmail.com','*45Aedas',9641851224]
```

Suppose now I need to find the password of Rahul, for that first we need to find the index of the password in the employees' array, and then from that index, we can find the password of Rahul.

### But is it a good approach?

Suppose a company has 5000 users and we store their data in such a

To address such situations objects were introduced.

# What is an Object?

An object is a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are also known as properties, and the values can be any data type, including strings, numbers, arrays, or even other objects.

## How to declare an Object?

```javascript
var details={}
```

in object the data are stored in key-value pairs

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "software developer",
  hobbies: ["reading", "swimming"]
};
```

# Properties of object

1.  **<mark>Accessing the value</mark>**
    
    ## Dot Notation
    
    **Syntax**
    
    ```javascript
     object.key
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    const person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      job: "software developer",
      hobbies: ["reading", "swimming"]
    };
    
    person.name //John
    person.age //30
    person.job //software developer
    person.hobbies  //  ["reading", "swimming"]
    person.hobbies[0]  //  reading
    ```
    
    # Bracket Notation
    
    **Syntax**
    
    ```javascript
     object["key"]
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    const person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      job: "software developer",
      hobbies: ["reading", "swimming"]
    };
    
    person['name'] //John
    person['age'] //30
    person['job'] //software developer
    person['hobbies']  //  ["reading", "swimming"]
    person['hobbies'][0]  //  reading
    ```
    
2.  **<mark>Adding new key</mark>**
    
    1.  Dot Notation
        
        ```javascript
        object.key=value
        
        var employees = {
        Rahul:'1,00,000',
        Suraj:'4,00,000',
        Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
        John:'1,00,000'
        }
        
        //To add new employee we can do 
        employees.Nishant='2,00,000'
        
        console.log(employees) 
         /*{Ashutosh: "5,00,000".
        John: "1,00,000",
        Nishant: "2,00,000",
        Rahul: "1,00,000",
        Suraj: "4,00,000"}*/
        ```
        
    2.  Bracket Notation
        
        ```javascript
        object['key']=value
        
        var employees = {
        Rahul:'1,00,000',
        Suraj:'4,00,000',
        Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
        John:'1,00,000'
        }
        
        //To add new employee we can do 
        employees['Nishant']='2,00,000'
        
        console.log(employees) 
         /*{Ashutosh: "5,00,000".
        John: "1,00,000",
        Nishant: "2,00,000",
        Rahul: "1,00,000",
        Suraj: "4,00,000"}*/
        ```
        
3.  **<mark>Deleting a key</mark>**
    
    ```javascript
    var employees = {
    Rahul:'1,00,000',
    Suraj:'4,00,000',
    Ashutosh:'5,00,000',
    John:'1,00,000'
    }
    delete employees.Rahul   // it will delete rahul key
    delete employees['Suraj']  // it will delete rahul key
    ```
    

# loops in object

The object cannot be iterated with a normal for loop as an object doesn't have an index as numbers. so to iterate objects we have a special loop that is <mark>for in</mark> loop.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "software developer",
  hobbies: ["reading", "swimming"]
};

for(let key in person){
// Keep in mind here you need to use box notation.
// also do console.log(key)

console.log(person[key])

}
```

# Arrays Inside Object

we can store an array inside objects as well.

```javascript
let detail = {
      title: "FB 3-Day: 3 Workouts Per Week for 2 Weeks",
      price: "7.99",
      difficultyLevel: [ 3,4],
      bodyFocus: "Total Body",
      equipmentData: ["Dumbbell", "Mat" ],
      trainingTypeData: ["Strength Training"]}
```

as in the above example, we have stored an array in an object.

we can store any data structure and data type as a value in an object such as a number, boolean, string, bigInt, array, and object as well.

Even we can store functions as well in the value part which we will learn about in the next session.

## The object inside the object (Nested Object)

```javascript

let school = {
  class11: {
      rahulMarks:  { english: 99, hindi: 100, maths: 70 },
   
  },
};
// to access the marks of english
school['class11']['rahulMarks']['english']
```

# Assignment

1.  create an object with five names as keys and give them a value.
    
    print all the keys using for in loop.
    
2.  You are given a variable
    
    ```javascript
    let str='asdnbknsadknsadnjk'
    ```
    
    To make an object using a loop that will give the key as the character and the value as a number of characters.
    
    **<mark>Sample Input</mark>**
    
    let str='saaslaa'
    
    **<mark>Sample output</mark>**
    
    {a:4,s:2,l:1}
    
3.  Write a function `countProperties` that takes an object as an argument and returns the number of properties (key-value pairs) in the object.
    
4.  Write a function `getPropertyNames` that takes an object as an argument and returns an array of all the property names (keys) in the object.
    
5.  Write a function `getPropertyValues` that takes an object as an argument and returns an array of all the property values (values) in the object.
    
6.  Write a function `sumValues` that takes an object as an argument and returns the sum of all the values in the object.
    
7.  Write a function `averageValue` that takes an object as an argument and returns the average of all the values in the object.
    
8.  Write a function `findLargestValue` that takes an object as an argument and returns the largest value in the object.
    
9.  Write a function `findSmallestValue` that takes an object as an argument and returns the smallest value in the object.
    
10.  Write a function `reverseProperties` that takes an object as an argument and returns a new object with the keys and values reversed (i.e. the keys become the values and the values become the keys).
    
11.  Write a function `findLongestKey` that takes an object as an argument and returns the longest property name (key) in the object.
    
12.  Write a function `swapProperties` that takes an object as an argument and returns a new object with the keys and values of the original object swapped (i.e. the values become the keys and the keys become the values).
