# Dev Retro 2022: From Doubt to Confidence: My Journey to Believe in Me.

Hello Hashnoders,

I am Nakul Goel, and my story is one of the most interesting yet inspiring for most of you as I am actually smiling while writing this blog because this blog will be one of the most interesting blogs I ever wrote.

This blog is about my journey and how in just one year, my life changed from a corporate employee to an entrepreneur to a coder and now a knowledge disperser.

**sounds interesting, isn't it?**

I told you this story will be inspiring for all of those who are afraid to accept the word that is change.

Below is my journey:-

## Resignation - A horror story

I come from a typical Indian family where resigning from a very good job and starting a new business is considered not good. My family was against my resignation from the job and actually, they were also correct because they care for me but I was not happy with my job as my passion was to start my own venture somehow I convinced them and I resigned- the most horrifying phase in my life.

with a little money in my pocket, I am standing on the road thinking

### What's NEXT?

## Becoming Entrepreneur

After resigning what's next I had a lot of ideas in my mind that what to start so then comes the research part and after researching a lot.

I registered my two companies with the government of India named as `Tarshika Travel Booket Private Limited` and `VLG Online Pooja Ghar Private Limited` .

### VLG Online Pooja Ghar Private Limited

This is my first company whose aim is to become India's first spiritual E-commerce marketplace that caters to the field of religious products in India.

### Tarshika Travel Booket Private Limited

This was my second company whose aim is to become India's number 1 travel planner company that actually provides the best services to the customer.

## Becoming Programmer

Both of my companies are technology driven and I realized that to run both companies I need to learn coding that's how I landed up in coding, with little experience in developing WordPress sites using themes so I thought coding will take only one month or so but to realization, it is a never-ending process.

### The biggest problem with aspiring developer

1.  **College**\- they don't teach you what's required by the industry.
    
2.  **Youtube**\- The courses on youtube are good but there is no proper roadmap to study (students end up studying which is not required `Tutorial Hell`) and their doubts are never solved.
    
3.  Good courses take a lot of money which many of us can't afford.
    

## Becoming Knowledge Disperser

Now that I know a lot of aspiring developers are facing many issues I thought of sharing my knowledge with all of them and was looking for the right platform and there I found hash node.

A place where I can share my knowledge with other aspiring developers and also learn more from the senior developers and that is how I landed up here.

I have written 26+ articles on web development and started two courses related to web development and all the courses are free of cost.
